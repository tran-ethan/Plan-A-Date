# Plan-A-Date
Imagine you ask out your crush, and they agree to go out with you. You're excited. And why shouldn't you be? but there's just one problem... Where will you go? That's where we come in.Finding a romantic partner has remained one of the hardest challenges for computer science students. As my friends and I struggle with this problem very frequently, I decided to make this web app to help solve the problem of making date plans
## What it does
You simply enter some information: age, gender, date, time, interests, postal code, and price range, and it will recommend date locations based on that information
## How we built it
HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templating engine for the front-end, and Flask for the backend. Using Python in combination with Google's client-side Places API, we were able to fetch data from Google Maps and display dynamically.
